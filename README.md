# Build a Synthetic Monitoring Platform

## YAML Parser
Write a Python program to read the YAML file and gracefully handle errors to read configuration files in our project.

**Additional Notes:**

- Consider using a try...except block for error handling.
- Use the ‘yaml.safe_load’ method to prevent arbitrary code execution risks. 
- Clearly handle different error scenarios: File not found, invalid YAML syntax, etc.
- Provide meaningful error messages to the user for easier debugging.
